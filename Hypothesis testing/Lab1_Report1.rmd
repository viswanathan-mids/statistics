# Are Democratic voters older or younger than Republican Voters in 2020?


## Importance and Context

They say elections are decided by those who show up to vote. For question 1, 
we are trying to identify the ages of Democrat and Republican voters. In general,
there is a link between age and voting behavior. As people age, they are more 
likely to be at the top of their earnings, so they are more likely to favor 
traditional conservative policies such as lower taxation on higher earners. 
Also, younger people when it comes to voting care about getting a job, education
loan forgiveness, and the environment as compared to older voters who care more 
about health policies, retirement, social security, and other benefits. Because 
of this, we want to analyze if in the 2020 Election the Democratic voters were 
older or younger than Republican Voters.  

To help us answer this question, we used the dataset anes_timeseries_2020_stata_
20210324. The data set includes different attributes (per column) and includes 
values for age, voter registration status, and party affiliation. For this 
question we looked at variables V201507x (which was the Respondents Age) and 
V201018 (which was the Party of Registration). We created a new subset called 
“Registration” to extract data relevant for the voter age analysis. 

```{r load data, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

enes.stata <- read_dta(file="anes_timeseries_2020_stata_20210324.dta")
names(enes.stata)[names(enes.stata) == "V201507x"] <- "Pre_Summary_Resp_Age"
names(enes.stata)[names(enes.stata) == "V201018"] <- "Pre_Party_of_Registration"

```

```{r filter data out, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = "hide"}
Registration <- subset(enes.stata, select = c("Pre_Summary_Resp_Age", "Pre_Party_of_Registration"))

as_factor(Registration)

Registration <- Registration %>% mutate(Registration_Party = 
                                                  case_when(Pre_Party_of_Registration < 0 ~ "Not Needed",
                                                            Pre_Party_of_Registration == 1 ~ "Democrat",
                                                            Pre_Party_of_Registration == 2 ~ "Republican",
                                                            Pre_Party_of_Registration > 3 ~ "Not Needed")
                                                
)

Registration$Pre_Party_of_Registration <- as.numeric(as.character(Registration$Pre_Party_of_Registration))
Registration <- filter(Registration, Pre_Summary_Resp_Age >18)
Registration <- filter(Registration, (Registration_Party == "Democrat" | Registration_Party == "Republican"))
```


## Description of Data
A Democrat is a person
registered with the Democratic party, and this is a person who believes in the 
political or social equality of all people. A Republican is a person registered 
with the Republican party, and this is a person who favors or supports a 
republican form of government. For this analysis, we utilized the ANES 2020 Time Series Study dataset. In order
to adequately answer our question, we needed data that would show us age of the 
voters and what registered party they are affiliated with. 

Looking at Age (Variable V201507x), we saw that the range of voters was between 
-9 to 80. For both parties we noticed the max age was 80 (as anyone over the age
of 80 was listed as 80 too). To clean up “Age”, we decided to filter out any 
voters younger than 18, because they can not vote, and any voters that had -9 
because this represents voters who did not disclose their birth date. The second
variable we chose to keep is “Party of Registration” (Variable V201018) as it 
told us what political party each voter is registered with. Since we are wanting
to look at voters who are registered with the Democratic Party and Republican 
Party, we can filter out all other values.  

```{r histogram, echo=FALSE, warning=TRUE, message=FALSE}

Registration_histogram <- Registration %>%
  ggplot() + aes(x = Pre_Summary_Resp_Age, fill = Registration_Party) +
  geom_histogram(position ='dodge', bins=16) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue", "red")) +
  labs(title    ='Voter Age: Democrat vs Republican',
       subtitle ='Are Democratic voters older or younger than Republican voters',
       x        ='Voter Age',
       y        ='Count of Observations',
       fill     ='Political Party Affiliation') +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
Registration_histogram
```

Originally we started out with 8,280 entries but after filtering out voters 
younger than 18/voters whos birthday did not register and only looking at the political party affiliation of 
“Democrat” or “Republican”, we are left with 3,067 entries too analyze and 
compare. 


```{r setting up for the test, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Summary of Republican Voters (sd= 16.664, mean = 55.89, sample size= 1,255 )
Republican_Age <- filter(Registration,Registration_Party == "Republican")
#Summary of Democrat Voters (sd= 17.205, mean = 52.66,sample size= 1,792  )
Democrat_Age <- filter(Registration,Registration_Party == "Democrat")
```

Summary of Republican Voters
```{r setting up for the test1, echo=FALSE, warning=TRUE, message=FALSE}
#Summary of Republican Voters (sd= 16.664, mean = 55.89, sample size= 1,255 )
summary(Republican_Age$Pre_Summary_Resp_Age)
```
Summary of Democratic Voters
```{r setting up for the test2, echo=FALSE, warning=TRUE, message=FALSE}
#Summary of Democrat Voters (sd= 17.205, mean = 52.66,sample size= 1,792  )
summary(Democrat_Age$Pre_Summary_Resp_Age)
```
```{r sample audit table, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.cap="Sample Size Audit."}
knitr::include_graphics("Sample.jpg")
```
## Most appropriate test 
Our analysis aims to determine if Democratic voters are older or younger than 
Republican Voters. Our group decided to use a t test since we have two groups, 
Democrats and Republicans. The reason we went with this test is because we have 
Age data which is a numeric metric scale and the data is independent and 
identically distributed. We can assume this is IID data because there is a large
sample size for both the parties and we can see that it is close to a normal 
distribution. Based on that, for our Null Hypothesis, we define it as H{0}: mean
age for democrat voters = mean age for republicans voters. Alternate Hypotheses 
is defined as H{1}: mean age for democrat voters !=mean age for republicans voters.

Additionally, since the response variable, Age, is metric data, a parametric
test is appropriate as we will be comparing the mean ages of the respective parties. 
We plan to use the Cohen’s d Test in the analysis to see how effect size plays a role.

```{r tests, echo=FALSE}
#T test for Democrat Age vs Republican Age 
t.test(Democrat_Age$Pre_Summary_Resp_Age,Republican_Age$Pre_Summary_Resp_Age)

#Cohen's D test Democrat Age vs Republican Age (Practical Significance)
cohen.d(Republican_Age$Pre_Summary_Resp_Age,Democrat_Age$Pre_Summary_Resp_Age)

```

## Test, results and interpretation
The question we are trying to answer is, Are Democratic voters older or younger 
than Republican Voters in 2020? When conducting a Welch Two Sample t-test we see
that the p-value is equal to 2.007e-07. This indicates a high statistical 
significance, and we can therefore reject the null hypothesis in which the mean 
age for voters in the democratic and republican party is equal at a 95% 
confidence interval. We see that the mean for Democratic voters is 52.6 and the 
mean for Republican voters is 55.89 which means that the average republican 
voter is about 3.5 years older than the democrat average voter’s age. 

To find the practical significance, our group also conducted a Cohen’s D Test at
a 95% confidence interval and got an effect size of approximately .1901. Since
difference between two groups (Democrat Voters and Republican Voters) is less 
than 0.2, the effect size is small and therefore difference is negligible, even 
if the relationship is statistically significant. Despite the classification of 
the effect size, future governors and policy makers can leverage this 
information and can conclude that Democratic Voters are younger than Republican 
Voters according to our data.
